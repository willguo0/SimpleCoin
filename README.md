CSCI 1951L BrunoCoin Project README


For unit testing, we created four testing files in the test folder for each of the four
major portions of the project:

	blockchain_test.go tests the blockchain functions

	miner_test.go tests the miner functions

	wallet_test.go tests the wallet functions

	validation_test.go tests the validation functions

The project passes all of the given tests as well as all of our own unit tests.


This is our final hand-in for the project.
